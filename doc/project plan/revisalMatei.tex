2.2 - make clear it should be an independent web app that uses some cloud tools/algorithms in the background, so that it reaches an even broader target audience
2.3 - maybe less techincal details, focus more on them not being very good as en-to-end products, bad usability, focus on what we will do better than them
2.4 - cut the changeable cloud platform, rely on terra, otherwise good
2.4.1 - make clear end to end gui, no external messing with cloud computing service
2.4.2 - okay
2.5 - cut most of it, since it's a could/won't have
add API section? detailing how an api looks and how it should be? modular?
2.6 - mention how we will use cloud platform only as API, to make it even easier/nicer
2.6.1 - refocus on terra api

3 - more gui/api requirements as must/ should haves
3.4 - maybe shorten previous stuff, add today's discussion as another negotiation of requirements step

4.1 - could be shorter
4.1.1 - describe gui, using api
4.1.2 - replace with front end js
add back end node js ( also need to add this to problem analysis?)
4.1.3 - ok
add api section, mention how they'll support the features described in 4.1.4
4.1.4 - ok
4.1.5 - we could leave this if algorithm is a could have

5 - i'll redo the schedule a little bit to what coach said
be clear the product should be almost done (in our opinion) by the midterm meeting


2.5 make shorter
2.2, 2.4.1 (wrap pipelien in gui, js), 2.6 (make clear we'll wrap terra api in our app)         
4.1.1 rewrite
less for 4.1.5
revise scheduling
