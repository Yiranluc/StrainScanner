    abstract = "{Motivation: Counting the number of occurrences of every k-mer (substring of length k) in a long string is a central subproblem in many applications, including genome assembly, error correction of sequencing reads, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat detection. Recently, the deep sequence coverage generated by next-generation sequencing technologies has caused the amount of sequence to be processed during a genome project to grow rapidly, and has rendered current k-mer counting tools too slow and memory intensive. At the same time, large multicore computers have become commonplace in research facilities allowing for a new parallel computational paradigm.Results: We propose a new k-mer counting algorithm and associated implementation, called Jellyfish, which is fast and memory efficient. It is based on a multithreaded, lock-free hash table optimized for counting k-mers up to 31 bases in length. Due to their flexibility, suffix arrays have been the data structure of choice for solving many string problems. For the task of k-mer counting, important in many biological applications, Jellyfish offers a much faster and more memory-efficient solution.Availability: The Jellyfish software is written in C++ and is GPL licensed.

title={progressiveMauve: Multiple Genome Alignment with
Gene Gain, Loss and Rearrangement},
journal={PLoS ONE},
year={2010},
month={6},
day={25},
volume={5},
number={6},
abstract={Background: Multiple genome alignment remains a challenging problem. Effects of recombination including
rearrangement, segmental duplication, gain, and loss can create a mosaic pattern of homology even among closely
related organisms.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe a new method to align two or more genomes that have undergone
rearrangements due to recombination and substantial amounts of segmental gain and loss (flux). We demonstrate that the
new method can accurately align regions conserved in some, but not all, of the genomes, an important case not handled by
our previous work. The method uses a novel alignment objective score called a sum-of-pairs breakpoint score, which
facilitates accurate detection of rearrangement breakpoints when genomes have unequal gene content. We also apply a
probabilistic alignment filtering method to remove erroneous alignments of unrelated sequences, which are commonly
observed in other genome alignment methods. We describe new metrics for quantifying genome alignment accuracy which
measure the quality of rearrangement breakpoint predictions and indel predictions. The new genome alignment algorithm
demonstrates high accuracy in situations where genomes have undergone biologically feasible amounts of genome
rearrangement, segmental gain and loss. We apply the new algorithm to a set of 23 genomes from the genera Escherichia,
Shigella, and Salmonella. Analysis of whole-genome multiple alignments allows us to extend the previously defined
concepts of core- and pan-genomes to include not only annotated genes, but also non-coding regions with potential
regulatory roles. The 23 enterobacteria have an estimated core-genome of 2.46Mbp conserved among all taxa and a pangenome of 15.2Mbp. We document substantial population-level variability among these organisms driven by segmental
gain and loss. Interestingly, much variability lies in intergenic regions, suggesting that the Enterobacteriacae may exhibit
regulatory divergence.
Conclusions: The multiple genome alignments generated by our software provide a platform for comparative genomic and
population genomic studies. Free, open-source software implementing the described genome alignment approach is
available from http://gel.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve.},

In version 6.0, MEGA now enables the inference of timetrees, as it implements the RelTime method for estimating divergence times for all branching points in a phylogeny. A new Timetree Wizard in MEGA6 facilitates this timetree inference by providing a graphical user interface (GUI) to specify the phylogeny and calibration constraints step-by-step. This version also contains enhanced algorithms to search for the optimal trees under evolutionary criteria and implements a more advanced memory management that can double the size of sequence data sets to which MEGA can be applied. Both GUI and command-line versions of MEGA6 can be downloaded from www.megasoftware.net free of charge.

title={Fast and accurate approximate inference of transcript expression from RNA-seq data},
journal={Bioinformatics},
year={2015},
month={8},
day={26},
volume={31},
number={24},
abstract={Motivation: Assigning RNA-seq reads to their transcript of origin is a fundamental task in transcript expression estimation. Where ambiguities in assignments exist due to transcripts sharing sequence, e.g. alternative isoforms or alleles, the problem can be solved through probabilistic inference. Bayesian methods have been shown to provide accurate transcript abundance estimates compared with competing methods. However, exact Bayesian inference is intractable and approximate methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and Variational Bayes (VB) are typically used. While providing a high degree of accuracy and modelling flexibility, standard implementations can be prohibitively slow for large datasets and complex transcriptome annotations.

Results: We propose a novel approximate inference scheme based on VB and apply it to an existing model of transcript expression inference from RNA-seq data. Recent advances in VB algorithmics are used to improve the convergence of the algorithm beyond the standard Variational Bayes Expectation Maximization algorithm. We apply our algorithm to simulated and biological datasets, demonstrating a significant increase in speed with only very small loss in accuracy of expression level estimation. We carry out a comparative study against seven popular alternative methods and demonstrate that our new algorithm provides excellent accuracy and inter-replicate consistency while remaining competitive in computation time.

Availability and implementation: The methods were implemented in R and C++, and are available as part of the BitSeq project at github.com/BitSeq. The method is also available through the BitSeq Bioconductor package. The source code to reproduce all simulation results can be accessed via github.com/BitSeq/BitSeqVB_benchmarking.

abstract={MOTIVATION:
Although many next-generation sequencing (NGS) read preprocessing tools already existed, we could not find any tool or combination of tools that met our requirements in terms of flexibility, correct handling of paired-end data and high performance. We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data.

RESULTS:
The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:
Trimmomatic is licensed under GPL V3. It is cross-platform (Java 1.5+ required) and available at http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic
