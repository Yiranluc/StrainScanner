Sprint feedback:

splitting of issues not clear, all code in master is from one person, keep distribution equal
show progress on the TA side of Mattermost
put WDL script and Dockerfile in the project root to display on GitLab
reflect progress and show code feedback on GitLab!
merge requests should be named better and linked to issues
make sure commit messages are sensible
people should stay familiar with the code even when writing just config files
pipeline should fail when coverage is under the must-have limit
