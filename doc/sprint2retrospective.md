Good points during the past week:

1. client communication has improved!
2. swift response to the surprise regarding the technology change (from Terra to directly using Google Cloud)
3. dailies have been shorter!
4. sprint planning was better

Things to improve on:

1. more pair programming can be a good way to progress faster
2. more people need to commit and submit merge requests, and each programmer should take responsibility from issue to MR
3. keep all team members more up to date with what you are doing (e.g. keep recording on GitLab how much time you spent on the issues)
4. master branch currently does not work!
