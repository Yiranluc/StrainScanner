Issues about previous sprint

matei  - hard to work, too little pressure
konsta - most of the stuff didn't get done, issues will carry on to next sprint, issue definition, spend more time on divisions
daglar - better work division, in order to get more people interested in what they're doing
petar  - 
yiran  - more effort, more fleshed out definitions


Actionable plan to solve mentioned issues

-longer sprint planning sessions, involve everyone in the process, collaborate on  defining an issue

-keeping dailies shorter, hard to follow sometimes
